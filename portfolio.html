        <h1>Immaculate Wanjiku Ngugi</h1>
        <h2>This is my story..</h2>
        <p>I'm Immaculate, a lover of life and good food, currenty working as a Core Network Engineer in Safaricom PLC Data Support Team for the past 1 year. Before joining Safaricom I have worked in three other different companies; starting out as a Customer Support Engineer and finally specializing in <strong>Mobile Data Networks</strong>. My current main area of focus is in service awareness where I deal with unique network features to treat different traffic uniquely. </p>
        <p>When I'm not working I mostly spend my time with my son marvelling at his curiosity as he uncovers new features of the world around him every day. I also do enjoy reading books and my current interest is in African authors. I am into fitness as well and took up hiking a few years ago which I now thoroghly enjoy and so I endeavour to hike monthly or bimonthly.</p>
        <p>For my studies, I hold a degree in <em>Telecommunications and Information Engineering</em> from JKUAT. I've mainly worked in networking and my work experience mainly lies in this. Robotics for me has always been a fascinating area and seeing how much of our day to day activities are getting automated, studying robotic process automation was a challange that seemed quite exciting. I hope to understand the intricacies of automation as part of getting future ready.</p>
